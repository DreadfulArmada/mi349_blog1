    <p> Is <em>Breaking Bad</em> really the best show ever? Some might say it is. IMBD rates <em>Breaking Bad</em> as a 9.4 out of 10.
    It is tied for first with <em>Planet Earth</em>">. Personally, I think its very good. Currently, I am on season 4 and it is thrilling!
    Walt and Jessie have a really interesting relationship to watch, which makes the show very compelling. I think my favorite character
    has to be Saul Goodman. He makes me laugh everytime he is on screen with his antics. </p>

     <p> think that an arguement can be made that <em>Better Call Saul</em> might even be better, but I will have to see for myself.
    Multiple friends and family have told me that <em>Better Call Saul</em> is the better show. I can see why they would say that.
    Saul is a great character and he always has an answer to everything you throw at him. </p>

    <p>I think, and this is biased, but <em>The Sopranos</em> can be a good contender for best show of all time. IMBD ranks <em>The Sopranos</em>
    as the Tenth best show of all time, but personally I think it should higher than that. Who even wants to watch <em>Planet Earth</em>? Tony Soprano is the goat (greatest of all time).
    This man gets the job done. </p>

    <p> Let me know what yall think in the comments. </p>

    <p>Is <em>The Sopranos</em> better than Breaking Bad? I think there is really an argument to be made here. Tony Soprano is one of the best characters in all of 
    television. Tony is a complex character that we really only come to understand towards the end of the show. <em>The Sopranos</em> set the stage so that <em>Breaking Bad</em>
    would be able to be so good. Without <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em> would not even be a good show. In fact, when watching <em>Breaking Bad</em> they give nods to
    <em>The Sopranos</em> in a couple of scenes.</p>

    <p><em>The Sopranos</em> really set the stage for TV dramas. It was one of the first and best types of TV dramas to come out. IMBD sets <em>The Sopranos</em>
    as the tenth best show of all time. I think that theres something to be said for it being the tenth best show. All of the characters are very well written and fleshed
    out. Chris and Adriana are one of the most iconic couples of all time, and I don't care if you disagree. You can't argue with the facts</p>

    <p>Either way, bost shows are very good in their own right. Both are blockbuster hits and should be regarded as so. Tony and Chris are just as equal as 
    Walt and Jessie. Both duos are very compelling characters to watch.</p>
