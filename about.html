    <p>My name is Jake Sloan. I am a student at Michigan State University studying Media and Information. I am 23 years old and I have lived in Michigan my whole life.
    I want to make video games after college. I think this can be something that I will really shine at. I have been playing them ever since I was 3 years old and 
    I really enjoy the process of seeing how they are made and what kind of work goes into them. </p>

    <p> Other things that I enjoy doing are fishing and hunting, working out, and hanging out with friends and family. My whole family (except my sister for some reason) practive ju jitsu 
    together. My mom, dad, and brother get to go more often because I have to live in East Lansing, but I like to go when I can. I really enjoy the flow of 
    ju jitsu and learning new moves. I honestly wish that I could practice more often, but responsibilites get in the way. </p>

    <p>Some of my hobbies are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing guitar (I'm not very good)</li>
        <li>Ju Jistu</li>
        <li>Working Out</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
        <li>Hunting and fishing</li>
    </ul>
